## ‚úÖ Core Functionality Breakdown

### Multi-Tenancy Architecture
*   **Approach:** Implemented a shared schema with a `tenantId` on relevant tables to logically separate data.
*   **Tenants:** The application is pre-seeded with two tenants: **Acme** and **Globex**.
*   **Isolation:** A robust middleware layer ensures that all database queries are strictly scoped to the authenticated user's tenant.
*   **Security:** Cross-tenant data access is impossible by design.

### Authentication & Authorization
*   JWT-based authentication with a **24-hour token expiration**.
*   Role-based access controls for Admin and Member users.

#### Test Accounts
Use the following accounts for testing. The password for all accounts is `password`.

| Email                 | Password   | Tenant | Role   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| `admin@acme.test`     | `password` | Acme   | Admin  |
| `user@acme.test`      | `password` | Acme   | Member |
| `admin@globex.test`   | `password` | Globex | Admin  |
| `user@globex.test`    | `password` | Globex | Member |

### Subscription Feature Gating
*   **Free Plan:** Limited to a maximum of **3 notes** per tenant.
*   **Pro Plan:** Allows for **unlimited notes**.
*   **Upgrade Endpoint:** Admins can upgrade a tenant via `POST /tenants/:slug/upgrade`.
*   **Real-time:** The note creation limit is removed immediately upon successful upgrade, without requiring a new login.
